Hey look, buddy. I'm a software engineer. That means I solve problems. Not problems like _"What is Beauty?"_ because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy... I solve **_practical problems_**.

For instance, how am I going to take some long, complicated, tedious information process and make it easy for all?

The answer: write some code. And if that don't work... write more code.
